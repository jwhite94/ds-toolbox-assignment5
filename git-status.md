### Definition: git status

git status can provide the following information:

1. **Current Branch**: shows the branch you're currently on, which is useful for making sure you're working in the right context for your project.
2. **Staging Area**: displays the status of files in the staging area compared to your last commit.
3. **Untracked Files**: lists files that are in your working directory but haven't been added to the staging area (and thus aren't being tracked by Git).
4. **Unstaged Changes**: indicates changes that have been made to tracked files but haven't been staged (added to the list of files to be included in the next commit).
5. **Staged Changes**: It shows which changes have been added to the staging area and are ready to be committed in the next commit.


You can access the same information using the "Git" tab in the sidebar within the JupyterLab IDE.
